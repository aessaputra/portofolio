### Public
- `/` (portfolio home)
- `/about`
- `/projects`
- `/articles`
- `/certifications`
- `/not-authorized`

### Auth Flows
- `/sign-in` (public landing)
- `/post-sign-in`
- `/auth/magic-link` (token redirect)

### Admin
- `/admin` (redirect hub)
- `/admin/sign-in`
- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/home`
- `/admin/about`
- `/admin/projects`

## Component Snapshot Checklist
Capture screenshots for the following pages with the default seeded data:
1. Portfolio Home (`/`)
2. About (`/about`)
3. Projects (`/projects`)
4. Articles (`/articles`)
5. Certifications (`/certifications`)
6. Public Sign-in (`/sign-in`)
7. Admin Dashboard Overview (`/admin/(auth)/dashboard`)
8. Admin Projects list (`/admin/projects`)
9. Admin Certifications list (`/admin/certifications`)

The automated script saves images under `docs/baseline/screenshots/YYYYMMDD/`.

## Change Tracking
- Baseline created: TODO (update with date once screenshots are captured).
- Subsequent updates should note comparison results, e.g. "2025-02-03: Home hero padding adjusted (expected)."
